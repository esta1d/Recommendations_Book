## Project Goal
Develop a book recommendation system based on machine learning methods and data analysis to provide users with personalized suggestions of literature that match their interests and preferences.


## Relevance
The market for eBooks is constantly growing, leaving users overwhelmed by the vast number of choices available. An effective recommendation system simplifies the process of finding suitable books, enhances user satisfaction, and increases sales on digital distribution platforms.

## Main Tasks:
* Data Collection and Preparation
* * Gather metadata about books (genre, author, publisher, rating).
* * Collect reviews and ratings from users.
* User Preference Analysis
* * Cluster users based on similar literary tastes.
* * Analyze user behavior (reading habits, purchases, evaluations).
* Recommendation Model Development
* * Implement collaborative filtering and content-based algorithms.
* * Create a hybrid model combining advantages of both approaches.
